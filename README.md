# 1st Year Dump

This is my dump repository for my first year at UFRJ (Federal University of Rio de Janeiro). Most of my (kinda) useless files are here for organization.

## CC50
The CC50 repository is the home of my solutions for the first 2 classes of the [CS50 Harvard program](https://www.youtube.com/@cs50).

## C
The C repository contains all programs that I made using C language. It was divided by my disciplines.

## C++
The C++ repository contains one or two programs that I made when I was discovering the world of C++
